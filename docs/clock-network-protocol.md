This is the Pico-side clock-source interface, independent of displays and the
future ESP32 implementation. The source owns UTC; the controller is a read-only
consumer. MOSI carries dummy bytes, never commands. No network observation can
set or discipline the source clock. No holdover is implemented.

## Electrical and transaction contract

3.3 V logic only, common GND, short wiring. RP2350 is native SPI1 peripheral;
ESP32 is controller. GPIO numbers are not physical header numbers.

| Pico GPIO | Header pin | Direction at Pico | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GP8 | 11 | input | SPI1 RX / controller MOSI |
| GP9 | 12 | input | SPI1 CSn, active low |
| GP10 | 14 | input | SPI1 SCK |
| GP11 | 15 | output | SPI1 TX / controller MISO |
| GP12 | 16 | output | TIME_SYNC |
| GP13 | 17 | reserved | future control/IRQ, not initialized |

This corrects the earlier wiring draft's controller-oriented MISO/MOSI labels.
TX/RX directions do not swap in peripheral mode. GP9 has an internal pull-up;
SCK/MOSI have pull-downs for an absent controller. TIME_SYNC starts low. MISO
is hardware-tristated when CS is high.
Do not drive unpowered boards through their IO; arrange shared power sequencing
or isolation where independent power is needed.

SPI **mode 1** (CPOL=0, CPHA=1), MSB first, 8-bit words, at **100 kHz**. The
current Pico implementation is hardware-qualified at this rate with the
controller and wiring described here.
Mode 1 is intentional: PL022 SPH=1 permits continuous frames under one CS.

Controller procedure:
1. Allow 1 second after Pico startup before the first request. Keep CS high at
   least 1 ms between transactions; at most 10 transactions/second.
2. Assert CS low, wait **at least 100 us** for the bounded CS interrupt to
   select an immutable snapshot, and preload the FIFO. Do not clock earlier.
3. Clock exactly **40 bytes** continuously, sending zeroes on MOSI.
4. Hold CS low at least **10 us after the last trailing SCK edge**, then deassert it. Validate signature/version/length,
   reserved fields and CRC before using any data. Reject incomplete reads.

CS falling latches the latest fully published packet. It cannot change during
that transaction. Short/extra/aborted transactions never affect the clock. After
CS rises, SPI1 is reset to discard old FIFO/partial-word state and re-armed
while deselected. It is configured as a slave but remains disabled with an empty
TX FIFO while idle. On CS falling the handler snapshots the latest packet and
primes eight TX entries before enabling the SSP. CS falling does not reset or
reconfigure it. CS/SCK output-enable overrides keep
these controller-owned signals input-only even during reset. A GP9-only SDK raw
handler acknowledges explicit edge identities; duplicate falling notifications
cannot destroy an active transfer, and Arduino PPS dispatch remains independent.
These rules are intentional. The first-byte failure showed why an enabled,
empty SSP must not precede the selected frame: the observed leading zero matched
an empty/stale first transmit frame. RP2350 section 12.3.4.3 permits loading the
TX FIFO while SSE is clear; firmware now primes it from the CS-boundary snapshot
before enabling. The precise old shifter state was inferred, not directly
captured. The reset storm likewise tracked fresh GP9 events across reset, while
its exact analogue pad transient was not scoped. The full evidence, measured
startup transients and steady-state results are in the permanent
[reset-storm and TX-alignment record](pico-spi-investigation.md).

Extra complete bytes are counted as malformed; sub-byte tails cannot always be
counted by this SPI peripheral. Stop after 40 bytes: surplus output is unspecified, not another packet.
After 48 received bytes transport interrupts are disabled until CS rises, bounding
service for a stuck/overclocking controller. A CS held low without clocks does not
block the main loop. No busy waits on controller activity, DMA, or PIO are used.

## Packet layout (40 bytes)

Multi-byte integers are **little endian**. Explicit byte serialization, no packed
C structures. Signed epoch uses 64-bit two's complement Unix seconds, ignoring
leap seconds as the source timebase does. Values beyond 2038 are supported.

| Offset | Size | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | magic | ASCII `ACT1` (41 43 54 31) |
| 4 | 1 | version | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | length | 40 |
| 6 | 2 | flags | below |
| 8 | 4 | packet_sequence | increments modulo 2^32 for each new published snapshot; first is 1 |
| 12 | 4 | boundary_sequence | source boundary counter (Pico PPS capture sequence); 0 before any capture; wraps modulo 2^32 |
| 16 | 8 | utc_seconds | authoritative UTC second beginning at that boundary; 0 when UTC_VALID clear |
| 24 | 4 | sync_sequence | count of TIME_SYNC rising edges this boot, modulo 2^32 |
| 28 | 4 | sync_delay_us | TIME_SYNC edge offset after captured boundary; FFFFFFFF if SYNC_VALID clear |
| 32 | 1 | satellites | satellites used, 0..99; FF when SAT_VALID clear |
| 33 | 3 | reserved | zero |
| 36 | 4 | crc32 | CRC of bytes 0..35, little endian |

Flags: bit 0 GPS_VALID; bit 1 PPS_PRESENT; bit 2 PPS_LOCKED; bit 3 UTC_VALID;
bit 4 HOLDOVER (reserved, always clear today); bit 5 SYNC_VALID;
bit 6 SAT_VALID. Bits 7..15 zero. GPS/PPS/UTC bits directly reflect one snapshot of
the existing authoritative State. GPS_VALID alone is NOT valid UTC. Neither
PPS_PRESENT nor UTC_VALID alone establishes a matching TIME_SYNC edge. Satellite
status is informational. A different clock provider may have GPS_VALID clear
while supplying a valid, locked authoritative 1-Hz boundary; GPS_VALID is not a
consumer prerequisite for UTC. Flags can change without a new epoch/edge.

CRC-32/ISO-HDLC: width 32, reflected polynomial ED B8 83 20 (normal 04 C1 1D B7),
init FFFFFFFF, reflected input/output, final XOR FFFFFFFF. Check value for ASCII
`123456789` is CBF43926. CRC detects corruption, not authentication.

## TIME_SYNC: boundary identity and measured delivery delay

GP12 rises once for a newly processed authoritative PPS boundary only when UTC
is valid, PPS present/locked, and processing age is at most **5000 us**. It returns
low at the first main-loop service at least 100 us later; pulse width is not a
precision quantity. Invalid UTC produces no new rising edges. Existing RMC/PPS
association remains the sole authority; RMC arrival never triggers this signal.
Late processing suppresses that edge rather than emitting a misleading late pulse.
The publisher commits boundary/epoch identity, delay and emitted-edge sequence
only after the final deadline check and GPIO rising write succeed. If the final
timer read crosses 5000 us, the edge is suppressed, the skipped count increases,
and the newly published authoritative boundary has SYNC_VALID clear and
sync_delay_us set to FFFFFFFF. `sync_sequence` remains the cumulative count of
edges actually emitted; it does not imply that the current boundary was emitted.

The rising edge is a software-delivered boundary reference, NOT a packet-ready
strobe and NOT a zero-latency electrical copy of GPS PPS. The packet epoch identifies
the PPS boundary; `sync_delay_us` measures the elapsed time from the existing PPS
capture timestamp to a timer read immediately before the GPIO rising write. The
consumer estimates that boundary at captured_TIME_SYNC - sync_delay_us. This
retains source PPS ISR timestamp latency, 1-us timer quantization and the short
read-to-GPIO-write delay; it does NOT establish calibrated sub-microsecond accuracy.
A requirement for an exact hardware-phase copy needs a separate timing design.

After a TIME_SYNC edge, wait **1 ms** before asserting CS to allow packet publication.
Check SYNC_VALID, UTC_VALID, PPS_LOCKED and PPS_PRESENT, then associate
sync_sequence and boundary_sequence with the captured edge. Read again if the
packet is still old. The first observed edge/packet establishes the consumer's
sequence alignment. Missed edges, sequence discontinuity, reboot, invalid flags,
or no edge for 1.5 seconds invalidate that phase association. Repeated SPI reads
are NOT new seconds. At boot the consumer discards any prior association.
Do not associate a packet fetched across the next TIME_SYNC edge with the wrong
edge: timestamp/count both edges and CS start, or discard/retry ambiguous reads.

SYNC_VALID remains set only for the current valid boundary and matching epoch
for which a pulse was emitted. On invalidation or a suppressed edge the packet
clears it and sets sync_delay_us to FFFFFFFF; sync_sequence retains its count.
An invalid packet's
zero epoch is a sentinel, not 1970 time. On recovery only a subsequent qualified
boundary emits a pulse. Every new PPS sequence or quality/count/epoch change
publishes a new coherent packet; no SPI read increments packet_sequence.

## Implementation and compatibility

Main-loop code reads State/Pulse only after Timebase::poll of that same capture.
It encodes into the inactive packet buffer then publishes its index with release
ordering. The same-core CS ISR acquires and copies a complete packet into its
transaction buffer; subsequent publications cannot alter it. Interrupt work is
bounded (40-byte copy and eight-entry FIFO preload on selection, reset/recovery
while deselected, or at most eight RX/TX FIFO accesses per SPI interrupt). The lifecycle protects these invariants:

- SPI1 reset/reconfiguration happens only while CS is high. CS/SCK output-enable
  overrides keep the controller-owned pins inputs through the peripheral reset.
- CS falling snapshots the latest published packet once. Later publications
  cannot alter the active frame.
- The initial TX FIFO entries are written while SSE is disabled; SSE is enabled
  only after they are ready. This avoids an empty preselection SSP state before
  byte zero while preserving snapshot-at-fall freshness.
- Duplicate/stale/coalesced CS notifications are handled using explicit GP9 edge
  events. They cannot reset or refill over an active transaction; ambiguous
  boundaries are rejected and the next clean deselected interval recovers.
- TIME_SYNC is a separate qualified GPIO pulse tied to the Pico PPS boundary.
  It is not carried by, triggered by, or authoritative through SPI. The ESP32
  consumes time and phase information and cannot set or discipline Pico UTC.
IRQ handlers never parse NMEA, convert UTC, format USB text or modify the
timebase. Arduino-Pico SPISlave streaming callbacks lack the needed CS framing,
so transport uses the bundled SDK SPI/GPIO/IRQ/reset APIs directly.

USB: one NET init message and one bounded NET summary per 60 seconds. The
summary's cumulative uint32 fields have these meanings:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tx` | Completed CS transactions handled by the transport. |
| `full` | Completed transactions with exactly 40 received bytes; it does not verify ESP CRC. |
| `short` | Completed transactions with fewer than 40 received bytes. |
| `extra` | Completed transactions with more than 40 received bytes. |
| `over` | Transactions where RX FIFO overrun was observed. |
| `csfault` | Rejected duplicate/stale or ambiguous CS event groups; not a physical edge count. |
| `sync` | Qualified TIME_SYNC rising-edge sequence count. |
| `skipped` | Eligible TIME_SYNC edges not emitted because capture was over 5 ms late or a final deadline recheck suppressed the edge. |

These counters wrap modulo 2^32 and remain cumulative from boot, including
startup transients. Read interval changes as well as absolute values. The six
transport counters use simple ISR increments and a short interrupt-disabled
snapshot; formatting and USB queue policy stay in the foreground. There is no
default per-second output. All resources remain local to the Pico repository.

Unknown protocol versions/lengths/reserved flags are rejected. An incompatible
layout or semantics requires a new version; reserved bytes/bits are not silently
repurposed in v1. Future HOLDOVER needs a specified uncertainty/age model and
consumer policy before activation. GP13 has no role in v1.

frames, fixed TX/RX directions, peripheral CS tristate, and TX FIFO priming while
SSE is disabled); installed Arduino-Pico and Pico SDK sources. Bench validation
with an actual SPI controller established 40-byte alignment, valid CRC packets,
source qualification and phase association at 100 kHz. Host tests cannot certify
electrical timing or TIME_SYNC offset/jitter.


## Golden vectors and validation

`test/host/network-v1-vectors.json` contains portable hex vectors generated with
Python `struct.pack` and `zlib.crc32`, independently of the C++ encoder. The host
suite checks those fixed bytes, every single-bit corruption in a packet,
header/reserved-field rejection with recomputed CRC, epochs through INT64_MAX,
invalid/GPS-only/PPS-unlocked states, sequence progression and immutable copies.
Actual transport code is also compiled against a native-SPI register model:
all 41 publication split points, all short byte counts, extra bytes, stalled CS,
TIME_SYNC gating, priming-before-SSE ordering, duplicate CS events and abort
recovery. The actual hardware results are documented above; the register model
does not replace electrical timing validation.
