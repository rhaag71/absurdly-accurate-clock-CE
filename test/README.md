# Host tests

Run from the repository root:

```sh
sh test/host/run.sh
```

Uses a host C++11 compiler with warnings treated as errors. No PlatformIO/Arduino
installation is required. Binaries live in temporary storage.

- `watchdog_test.cpp` checks normal/watchdog heartbeat intervals, exact toggle
  thresholds, repeated session cadence and unsigned millis wrap using production
  policy helpers. It also checks every-fifth-message reset reporting over 10,000
  messages, normal-boot suppression and fresh per-boot counters.
  Reset-cause hardware, watchdog expiry and actual acquisition
  after a reset require the physical bench procedure in the project README.

- `timebase_test.cpp` exercises the production GPRMC parser, UTC/PPS association,
  acquisition/correction, pulse loss/cadence, GPS loss, recovery, timestamp and
  sequence wrap, and second/minute/hour/day/month/year/leap-day rollovers.
- Display tests verify 20-cell layout/space placeholders, separate GPS/PPS flags,
  500 ms hold-0, every subsequent 50 ms rolling-decade threshold, final hold-9,
  PPS reset, missed phases,
  unavailable synchronization, timer wrap, and independence from UTC/RMC arrival.
- `vfd_test.cpp` exercises the actual driver and `clock_display::Output` through
  a small Arduino Print stub. It checks unchanged initialization/brightness,
  one-time clear plus short fields, no normal padding bytes, single-character
  updates, all ten-second rollovers, no per-second clears/full-row redraws,
  minimal status changes, and coalescing under UART backpressure/partial headers.
  A simulated screen maps transmitted spaces to zeroes to exercise the workaround.
- The full-row utility still has termination/padding tests, but it is not used by
  the normal clock display. Bounded short-field and position APIs are also tested.

Physical glyph mapping, cleared-cell appearance, UART latency and visual quality
require bench checks. Host tests do not establish the cause of the unit's
space-to-zero behavior.

- `hh_test.cpp` interprets the runtime byte stream into both 20-cell rows,
  including payload-free position commands, instead of assuming four-byte groups.
  It checks all 576 hour pairs at all four command boundaries for both HH cells,
  the decade cell, and all four status/count cells (16,128 cases), with bounded
  FIFO draining, writable=false stalls, and write() rejection. Another 10,000
  seeded repeated transitions cover 08/09/10/18/19/20/23/00/01 without cache resets.
  All 24 hour edges also run through actual PPS association and calendar conversion
  to the rendered screen. Full-frame/cache equality is checked after settling;
  intermediate multi-character updates are intentionally not atomic.
- Hour-range tests reject RMC hours 24..99, check all authoritative hour edges,
  and round-trip every hour in 2000..2099. A negative-epoch helper limitation is
  documented by test; it is not reachable from parser-accepted dates.
- A separately labelled fault-injection test drops an accepted leading-zero
  payload and demonstrates persistent visible `28` with intended/cached `08`.
  This documents missing physical-display feedback, not proof of hardware loss
  or a reproduction of the reported bug under normal transport assumptions.

- `timezone_test.cpp` covers UTC identity; every standard/daylight offset and label;
  all zones one second before/at/after fixed 2024–2027 U.S. DST transitions;
  previous-day/year/leap-day conversion; complete rendered zone changes and DST
  transitions under positioned writes;
  unchanged authoritative UTC, rolling phases and lower row;
  acceptance reporting under stalls/rejections/cancellation, and identical byte
  streams with diagnostics observation enabled or disabled.

- `hh_zero_test.cpp` targets physical x0->x8 reports: exact command bytes for
  00/01/10/11/20/21, 1,008 partial-command rendered loss/reacquisition cases,
  300 observed-zone scenarios and 500,000 seeded randomized service calls.
  An independent accepted-byte decoder must match the cache after every call;
  a delayed FIFO-fed screen must converge over both rows. Separate fault-injection
  controls distinguish a lost zero (leaves '-') from D3-high (0->8 and 1->9).
  See `docs/hh-zero-investigation.md`; injections do not prove hardware causation.

- `hh_pair_test.cpp` verifies contiguous `ESC H 07 tens ones` for 01->00,
  11->10, 23->00, invalidation/reacquisition, timezone changes and initial fields.
  Every transaction boundary is tested with competing label/indicator/status
  changes, UART refusal, frozen payload retries, and per-byte cache/completion
  events. Existing HH zero/fuzz tests enforce no explicit position 08 and correct
  five-byte HH sequences. Fault injections remain demonstrations of downstream
  faults, not proof that the physical symptom has been repaired.
